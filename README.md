## DISCLAIMER

> First of all, I would like to point out that I myself am certainly no 'expert' when it comes to matters of knowing all about the many different data encryption techniques; therefore, you should use extreme caution before following any of the advice that is being given herein; note that this is purely 'amateur' level data encryption; and, therefore, is NOT secure -(**do not attempt to secure very important data using these techniques which can very easily be broken**)-; rather this information is provided purely just for fun...so that 'beginners' will feel encouraged to go further experiment and learn more.  

## Multi-layering

1. Hide (The person should have to find out where the 'hidden' message is, first.) 
- Use internal 'source code' comments: HTML/CSS/Javascript/XML/-etc.
- Use external files to hide those comments in.
- Instead, of sending output to the document 'body' section; send it to alert message box/console.log/local or session storage.
2. Encrypt (Each message can be 'encrypted' using code.) 
- You can write the message backwards. (Text = txet)  
- You can swap each pair of letters around. (Text = eTxt)  
- Simple numbers encryption can be done as: A=1,B=2/../Z=26/-etc.  
- You can also do Binary/Hexadecimal/Octal  
- Or, invent your own form of data encryption techniques    

**NOTE**: Messages here are largely unencrypted.
