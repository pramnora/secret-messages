## DISCLAIMER

> First of all, I would like to point out that I myself am certainly no 'expert' when it comes to matters of knowing all about the many different data encryption techniques; therefore, you should use extreme caution before following any of the advice that is being given herein; note that this is purely 'amateur' level data encryption; and, therefore, is NOT secure -(**do not attempt to secure very important data using these techniques which can very easily be broken**)-; rather this information is provided purely just for fun...so that 'beginners' will feel encouraged to go further experiment and learn more.  

## Multi-layering

1. Hide (The person should have to find out where the 'hidden' message is, first.)  
2. Encrypt (Each message can be 'encrypted' using code.)  

**NOTE**: Messages here are unencrypted.
