## DISCLAIMER

> First of all, I would like to point out that I myself am certainly no 'expert' when it comes to matters of knowing all about the many different data encryption techniques; therefore, you should use extreme caution before following any of the advice that is being given herein. **NOTE**: This is purely 'amateur' level data encryption which is NOT in any way at all secure; therefore, **do not attempt to secure very important data using these techniques which can very easily be broken into**; rather this information is provided purely just for FUN...so that 'beginners' may feel encouraged to further experiment and learn more.  

## Multi-layering (hide/encrypt)  

1. **Hide** (The person should have to find out where the 'hidden' message is, first.) 
- Use internal 'source code' comments: HTML/CSS/Javascript/XML/-etc.
- Use external files to hide those comments in 
- (Links to external files might either be listed/or, unlisted inside of the original web page document 'source code'.)
- Instead, of sending output to the document 'body' section; send it to an alert message box/console.log()/local or session storage.
2. **Encrypt** (Each message can be 'encrypted' using code.) 
- You can write the message backwards. (Text = txet)  
- You can swap each pair of letters around. (Text = eTtx)
- In order to hide the message...it's often a good idea to delete such things as spaces/upper casing/symbols...which shows where a sentence starts/ends; or, where one word begins/ends; and, so on. (This is a sentence. = thisisasentence)  
- Simple numbers encryption can be done as: A=1,B=2/../Z=26/-etc.  
- As well as, using Decimal numbers/you can also use: Binary/Hexadecimal/Octal numbers. 
- Or else, choose to invent your own form of data encryption techniques.    

**NOTE**: Messages here are all unencrypted.
